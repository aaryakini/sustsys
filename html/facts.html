					<b class="peopleCircle">1</b><p class="peopleHead">CLIMATE CHANGE WILL LEAD TO MORE <u>TEMPERATURE</u>-RELATED DEATHS IN THE US.</p>
				</div>

				<li class="people">Days that are hotter than the average seasonal temperature in the summer or colder than the average seasonal temperature in the winter cause increased levels of illness and death by compromising the body’s ability to regulate its temperature or by inducing direct or indirect health complications. Loss of internal temperature control can result in a cascade of illnesses, including heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heatstroke, and hyperthermia in the presence of extreme heat, and hypothermia and frostbite in the presence of extreme cold. Temperature extremes can also worsen chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes-related conditions<br><a href="https://health2016.globalchange.gov/" target="_blank">Temperature Related Death and Illness Summary, Climate and Health Assessment 2016, U.S. Global Change Research Program, 2016</a></li>

					<b class="planetCircle">10</b><p class="planetHead">WHAT DOES WARM, STAGNANT AIR LEAD TO THE FORMATION OF? <u>OZONE</u></p>
				</div>

				<li class="planet">Because warm, stagnant air tends to increase the formation of ozone, climate change is likely to increase levels of ground-level ozone in already-polluted areas of the United States and increase the number of days with poor air quality.<br><a href="https://health2016.globalchange.gov/" target="_blank">Climate Impacts on Human Health, United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2017</a></li>

				</div>

				<li class="planet">People and animals and their diseases have been frozen in the permafrost for hundreds of years, but bacteria and viruses can survive in permafrost for hundreds of thousands of years—scientists recently revived a 30,000-year-old virus that infects amoebas. Diseases like the Spanish flu, smallpox or the plague that have been wiped out might be frozen in the permafrost. As the Arctic warms, more activity, like mining for rare earth or precious metals, could potentially put us in contact with them again.<br><a href="https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2018/01/11/thawing-permafrost-matters/" target="_blank">Why Thawing Permafrost Matters, State of the Planet, Columbia Climate School, 2018</a></li>

					<b class="planetCircle">13</b><p class="planetHead">WHAT CAUSES RISING SEA LEVELS? <u>THERMAL EXPANSION AND MELTING LAND ICE SHEETS</u></p>
				</div>

				<li class="planet">The two major causes of global sea level rise are thermal expansion caused by warming of the ocean (since water expands as it warms) and increased melting of land-based ice, such as glaciers and ice sheets. This puts coastal areas at greater risk of erosion and destructive storm surges and nuisance flooding which push land farther inland than they once did.<br><a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/sealevel.html" target="_blank">Is Sea Level Rising?, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce</a></li>

					<b class="planetCircle">15</b><p class="planetHead">THE PROLIFERATION OF <u>INVASIVE ALIEN SPECIES</u> IS EXACERBATED BY CLIMATE CHANGE.</p>
				</div>

				<li class="planet">Invasive alien species are among the main causes of biodiversity loss and species extinctions, and the proliferation of invasive species is often exacerbated by climate change. Native to South America, the water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) can now be found in parts of every continent except Antarctica, and it is expected to increase its range as the climate warms. The hyacinth deoxygenates rivers, killing fish populations, which in turn reduces income and food supply for local communities.<br><a href="https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-briefs/species-and-climate-change#:~:text=Climate%20change%20is%20currently%20affecting,direct%20result%20of%20climate%20change." target="_blank">Species and Climate Change, Issues Brief, International Union for Conservation of Nature</a></li>

				<div class="fact">
					<b class="planetCircle">16</b><p class="planetHead">WHAT ARE CARBON SINKS TURNING INTO? <u>CARBON SOURCES</u></p>
				</div>

				<li class="planet">Climate change affects the ability of plant species to sequester carbon, turning carbon sinks into carbon sources. Warmer temperatures are also increasingly leading to tree death caused by disease, drought conditions and an upsurge in the number and severity of forest fires, which leads to an increase in carbon emissions.<br><a href="https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-briefs/species-and-climate-change#:~:text=Climate%20change%20is%20currently%20affecting,direct%20result%20of%20climate%20change." target="_blank">Species and Climate Change, Issues Brief, International Union for Conservation of Nature</a></li>
