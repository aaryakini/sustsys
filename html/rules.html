		<p>
			The <i>Cards Against Humanity: Climate Change Pack</i> is recommended for three to five players.
		</p>

		<ul id="rulesbody">
			<li>The pack contains 48 response cards and one additional QR code card which can be scanned to access the 24 question cards online, along with the rules of the game, the real facts sheet and templates to make your own game.</li>
			<li>The prompt cards have been divided into three sections - People, Planet, and Profit, to highlight the impact of climate change on social well-being, the environment, and the economy respectively. There are two types of prompt cards - questions and fill-in-the-blanks.</li>
			<li>The response cards provide a number of potential answers to the prompt cards and any response card may be used to respond to any question card.</li>
			<li>To begin the game, the youngest player is designated the Card Czar. If multiple games are to be played, the first Card Czar will be the youngest, and the rest will follow in ascending order of age.</li>
			<li>Once the Card Czar has been designated, they must shuffle all of the response cards and distribute 3 response cards to each of the remaining players.</li>
			<li>The Card Czar then selects any prompt card from the online deck, and players use the response cards at their disposal to provide an answer to it. The response cards must be handed to the Card Czar face-down. If a player believes they do not have an appropriate response card to play and would like to preserve their cards, they may forfeit their turn.</li>
			<li>After receiving cards from all of the players, the Card Czar selects the funniest or most realistic response to the scenario at hand. The player that submitted the winning card gains a point.</li>
			<li>After each round, response cards are replenished to ensure that every player has at least 3 each.</li>
			<li>The game may be played until a set number of question cards have been played, or until they have all been completed.</li>
			<li>At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins.</li>
			<li>Players are also encouraged to reference the real facts page to view the correct answers to every prompt card in order to educate themselves and start a conversation about the real-life consequences of climate change.</li>
